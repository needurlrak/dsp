###Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do, focused on things that are new, interesting, or otherwise worth remembering.


 mkdir: creates a new directory in the current working directory


touch: creates a new file in the current working directory


..: moves the current working directory up on file


ls: lists all files and directories in the current working directory


pwd: view the current working directory path


The common redirection commands are:

">" redirects standard output of a command to a file, overwriting previous content.



>> redirects standard output of a command to a file, appending new content to old content.


<
 redirects standard input to a command.


| redirects standard output of a command to another command.


sort: sorts lines of text alphabetically.


uniq: filters duplicate, adjacent lines of text.


grep: searches for a text pattern and outputs it.


sed : searches for a text pattern, modifies it, and outputs it.
